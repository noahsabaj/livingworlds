# Clippy Configuration for Living Worlds
#
# This configuration focuses on catching real bugs and maintenance issues
# while being pragmatic about game development patterns.
#
# Created: 2025-09-13
# Purpose: Improve code quality without being overly pedantic

# Maximum cognitive complexity allowed per function
# (world generation and UI building can be complex)
cognitive-complexity-threshold = 30

# Allow longer functions for world generation and setup
too-many-lines-threshold = 200

# Allow more arguments for builder methods and complex systems
too-many-arguments-threshold = 10

# Bevy systems often need many parameters
type-complexity-threshold = 500

# Allow larger enums (TerrainType, etc.)
enum-variant-size-threshold = 256

# Don't warn on common game dev patterns in tests
# (These are handled via Cargo.toml [lints] section now)
